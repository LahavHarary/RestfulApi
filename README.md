Python Rest Api project
<br>
This project consists of 4 json files that contain data about virtual machines and firewall rules.
<br>
Each file contains different machines and different firewall rules.
<br>
The Api goal is to check whether a vm can be accessed from a different machine inside its folder.
<br>
To run the project localy on your computer run the "main.py" file and go to one of the following urls:
<br>
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/attack/PlaceMachineIdHere 
<br>
or 
<br>
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/stats/
<br>
Please make sure that if you picked the attack url you should enter a valid vm id instead of "PlaceMachineIdHere"
